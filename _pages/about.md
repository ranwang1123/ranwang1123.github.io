I am a PhD student at the University of Technology Sydney, working under the guidance of [Dr. Hua Zuo](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Hua.Zuo) and [Prof. Jie Lu](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Jie.Lu). I earned my master’s degree in Engineering from the University of Sydney in January 2022 and my bachelor’s degree in Engineering from 
University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in July 2020.

My research focuses on online transfer learning and vision-language models, including areas such as test-time adaptation and prompt learning.
